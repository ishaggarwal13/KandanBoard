# Kanban Board

A modern Kanban board application built with React, Firebase, and Material-UI. This project allows users to manage tasks efficiently by organizing them into columns such as "TODO," "IN PROGRESS," and "COMPLETED."

## Features

- **Create, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Add new tasks with details like title, description, due date, status, and priority. Edit or delete existing tasks as needed.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Task Priority**: Visualize tasks with priority labels (High, Medium, Low) and distinct color schemes.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase Firestore for real-time database management and authentication.
